# Titanic-Kaggle-Competition
My submission for the Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning Competition


The problem can be read here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/

The data set can be inspected here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

Briefly: The dataset contains Titanic passengers described by different features (name, social class, sex, age, ticket fare, cabin, etc) and the goal of the competition is to build a model to answer the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?”
